* Labels

Labels are flags which come with a message.  Usually: old, seen, replied,
flagged, and trashed.

The folder-types differ how they store label information.  Mbox folders
use the Status and X-Status fields, MH folders keep a seperate labels
file called .mh_sequences, and Maildir folders put the labels in the
name of the file.

Keeping the labels right is quite complicated.  The `[X-]Status' header
lines are only immediately updated with Mbox messages which will cause
them to be written.  Those lines are ignored for MH and Maildir, however
updated when a new version of such a message has to be written to
file.

The reason behind the MH/Maildir way of storing labels is pure
performance: labels are often needed.  Opening each message to see
how the labels are set is cheap for Mbox, which has to read the whole
folder on opening anyway, but terribly expensive for directory
origanized folders (as MH and Maildir) which need to take every
single message from a separate file.

Often used labels:
  draft     to be transmitted
  trashed   to be deleted
  flagged   selected
  current   last used
  replied   a reponse message was constructed
  seen      handled by the user
  old       existence of message seen by user in the previous opening
            of the folder.
