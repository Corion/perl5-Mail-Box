CHANGELOG of Mail::Box

All changes were made by Mark Overmeer <mark@overmeer.net>, unless
specified differently.

version 2.00_00:

        Most import changes:

	* Parsing in Inline::C

	* Moved code to use 5.6.0 features, so no support for 5.005
	  anymore.  This is required for Inline::C and Unicode support.
	  Mail::Box releases below 2 will be supported for some time
	  for people with `old' perl.

	* Removed all use of MIME::Parser, Mail::Internet, and MIME::Entity.

	Added:

	* Implemented Mail::Message::Field with tests in t/01field.t

	* Implemented Mail::Message::Head with tests in t/02head0h.t and
	  t/02head1r.t

	* Implemented Mail::Message::Part as sub-class of Mail::Message

	* Implemented Mail::Message::Body

	* Implemented Mail::Message::Body::String with tests in t/03body0s.t

	* Implemented Mail::Message::Body::Lines with tests in t/03body1l.t

	* Implemented base-class Mail::Error

        * Removed all Mail::Message::Mbox::Message help-classes, because they
	  became superfluous.

	* Implemented Mail::Reporter, which stores and displayes error and
	  trace reports for most Mail objects.

	All packages now have their own file.

	* Extracted Mail::Message::Dummy from Mail::Box::Message.pm, was
	  called Mail::Box::Message::Dummy.

	* Extracted Mail::Message::Head::Partial from Mail::Box::Message.pm,
          which was called Mail::Box::Message::NotParsedHead.

	* Extracted Mail::Box::Thread from Mail::Box::Threads.pm

	* Unfolding of headers considered stupid: headers which are
	  structured (check Mail::Message::Field::isStructured) may always
	  be multi-lined. Just specify the right options when you scan
	  through the line with regular expressions.

Before this, we had Mail::Box-1.xyz which also has a Changelog.  Most of
that information is not really useful because version >=2.0 is a really,
really major change, although there is strike for compibility.
